1)Java And Javac?

    Java and Javac both are JDK tools.Javac is used to compile the code and Javac is used to run the code
java is object oriented programming language and platform independent.

2)JDK,JRE,JVM?

JDK-Java Development Kit
In the JDK we can write the program and it strores in JDK bin folder.
JRE-Java Runtime Environment
JRE is used to execute the program
JVM-Java Virtual Machine
JVM is used to execute actual program

3)Limitations of array?

we have implicit and explicit choice in arrays
Once the array size created it will not change again
If we want to change we have to execute program again then it will allocate the size of the array.

4)Class,Object,Signature of the Class?

Class-Class is a blueprint of the object and class is non-primitive,datatype
Every class should have the body of the program
Object-Obeject is a Real time entity,whatever we are using the things those all are objects
that objects are using for method declaration.
Class signature?
class Metro{
System.out.println("Metro");//statement
}
Metro represents class name and {}these are represents body of the program 

5)Array?

Array is a Structured container which holds the data in sequence manner
Array contains index boxes
in array we can use iteration process

6).javafile and .classfile

.javafile- .javafile is readable and understandable for developers and users.It is in english language
.classfile-.classfile is only understandable for system because it is in byte code means it is in zeros and ones.

7)Length of the array:byte[]data={12,34,9,0,-62,88}

Length of the array is:len=length.data;
len=6

8)Method signature

class classname{
	public static void main(String[]args)//Main method declaration
	{
		
	}
}
public is acess specifier
static is non-acess specifier 
void is return type
main method name
(String[]args) is parameters

9)java?

java is a object-oriented programming language
It is platform independent
Once the code compiled it will generate bytecode if you want to run code on another platform the jvm will give bytecode no need to complile again.

10)Variable?

Variable is used to store the memory of the data
we can also call it ass refference variable.we cangive anyname to the refference variable but stating letter should be small because it is standard way.


11)Class variables?

Class variables means whatever we write as refference variables all are class variables.

12)Datatypes?

Datatype is used to know which data type we have declared
datatypes are two types 1.Primitive  2.Non-primitive
Primitive datatypes       
int                       
float
double
boolean
short
byte
Non-primitive datatypes
String
char

13)Java features?

Object oriented programming language
Platform independent
Have JVM
Security
Web development
Applications

14)Types of array?

15)Array index out of the box exception?

Array index out of the box is one of the Syntax error
This error occures when we give the index number out of length while we are retreiving the array.
For example,the length is 10 but we gave the index number 12 then we will get this array out of the box exception.

16)System.out.println();

It is a Statement
System is pre defined class
. It is dot operator which is used acess class members
out is static variables
println is static method
() In this parameters we can give any message we want.

17)double equal operator

It is used to check whether the two variables hold the same value or not.
a=2
b=2
then we can say a==b
If the variable values are not equal that time we will get error if we use this double equal operator

18)Use of . Operator?

Dot Operator is used to acess the members of class

19)base class of all classes?

Base class for the all classes is where we have created the main method that is base class
If in that program there is no main method then you will get error it will not compile.So,main method  class is base class for all classes. 
class Trial{
System.out.println("Message");
}
class Runner{
public static void main(String[]args)//Base class for all the classes
{
System.out.println("Main Method");
}
}

20)10 Java Keywords?

1.static
2.void
3.String
4.goto
5.return
6.private
7.public
8.packages
9.float
10.double
